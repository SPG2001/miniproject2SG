## Examinging the frequencies of names in the Faker package.

## Description

This project is designed to examine the frequency of names being generated by Faker to see how many are duplicates.
My hypothesis is that there will be some duplicate names used, however, it will be mostly random.

## Pip install instructions:

Please install the following packages:
```
pip install requirements.txt
```

## How to run:

```
python main.py
```

The program will run automatically and create a pair of bar graphs, as well as save the json file with the names to your
computer.
